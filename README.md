Open Source Software (OSS): Open source software refers to computer software whose source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute the code. This collaborative approach to software development fosters transparency, innovation, and community-driven improvement. Some well-known examples of open source software include the Linux operating system, the Mozilla Firefox web browser, and the Apache web server.
